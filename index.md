# 2020 TRIBOMECHADYNAMICS RESEARCH CAMP

## Call for applicants

The 2020 Tribomechadynamics Research Camp (TRC) takes place from August 3rd through September 4th, 2020, at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. The goal of the TRC is to bring together participants with diverse technical backgrounds from around the world to work in small teams on projects germane to interfacial mechanics and the dynamics of coupled structures. It is our hope that this experience will help form lasting collaborations and make significant progress towards solving several of the major challenges in these research areas. There is no registration fee, and free accommodation will be provided. 
The steering committee, Malte Krack (Stuttgart), Matthew Brake (Rice), and Christoph Schwingshackl (Imperial), are seeking 12 graduate students or postdocs to participate in this year’s projects:


### Project 1: Resonance Decay versus Resonance Tracking – Limitations and Opportunities

It is common to characterize the dynamics of a jointed structure by the evolution of resonance frequencies and damping ratios with vibration amplitude. In this project, we assess opportunities and limitations of two different approaches for identifying these nonlinear modal properties. The 1st method tracks the backbone curve using a phase controller and consequently analyzes steady-state vibrations. The 2nd method relies on freely decaying vibrations from resonance and uses advanced filtering techniques. Both methods are compared and assessed for our friction damping test rig, which offers good repeatability and strong nonlinearity (>35% frequency shift, >15% damping ratio of fundamental mode). While the drawback of the 1st method is the potential intrusiveness of the excitation, the challenge of the 2nd is the sensitivity to noise. The quality of the identified properties is analyzed by comparing against reference measurements of free and forced responses.

### Project 2: Minimizing Shaker-Structure Interactions in Free Decay Testing

The free decay measurements described in project 1 rely on switching off the excitation. For the small scale shaker test in project 1, this is achieved by retracting the stinger. For large scale shaker testing, traditionally used for high-amplitude excitation of engineering structures, this is infeasible. Here, the nature of the setup requires the test structure to be attached permanently to the excitation system, which leads to unwanted interaction between the shaker and the nonlinear system. Such interactions significantly affect the damping properties of the structure during free decay and can introduce undesired non-resonant higher harmonics in the excitation. This project seeks to characterize nonlinear shaker-structure interaction and investigate the potential of today’s techniques to minimize this effect.

### Project 3: Training-Based Hyper-Reduction for Reduced Order Modeling

One challenge in modeling structures with large interfaces is in the development of computationally tractable simulations. A potential solution to this is the use of hyper-reduced models. Hyper-Reduction refers to a reduction technique that results in a Reduced Order Model (ROM) that is complete by itself (i.e., all of the displacements and forces are fully described within the reduced coordinates). This project seeks to explore methods and to develop insights into finding methodologies for novel hyper-reduction (e.g, data-driven methods or the use of techniques such as modal derivatives). Starting with a technique for generating a hyper-reduced ROM, the main focus of this project will be developing new strategies for selecting the degrees-of-freedom to be retained in the ROM without losing accuracy.
